A set of default parameter values are automatically created when a new Linkage Project is created. To maximise linkage quality, it may be necessary to modify these to best suit the data in question.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/privacy-preserving":{"id":"advanced/privacy-preserving","title":"Privacy-preserving record linkage","description":"Privacy preserving record linkage (PPRL) refers to record linkage conducted on encoded or otherwise obfuscated identifiers. It is used to improve the privacy of the record linkage process. It allows linkage to occur without any personally identifying information being transmitted to the linkage unit.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"advanced/probabilistic-linkage":{"id":"advanced/probabilistic-linkage","title":"Probabilistic record linkage","description":"Probabilistic linkage, so called because it uses conditional probabilities to compute likelihoods, is one of the most common methods used for record linkage. In this approach, records are compared on a pairwise basis. A comparison of two records involves comparing all the individual fields. Each field comparison results in a score based on specific weights assigned to that field. These scores are summed up for the pair comparison, and if this summed score is over a specific threshold, the two records are designated a match.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/data-providers":{"id":"concepts/data-providers","title":"Data Providers","description":"Data Providers are the organisations/people who have agreed to provide data to LinXmart. All data received by the system must be associated with (i.e. belong to) a Data Provider. Event Types and Datasources both exist within the context of a Data Provider.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/data-sources":{"id":"concepts/data-sources","title":"Data Sources","description":"A data source represents the location from which a specific type of data can be ingested into the system. Each Event Type can have a number of data sources that define how data of that type can be sourced. These are listed below the Event Type itself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/envelopes":{"id":"concepts/envelopes","title":"Envelopes","description":"At its simplest, a LinXmart Envelope is a dataset paired with a descriptor that tells LinXmart what to do with it. These Envelopes exist as standard zip files containing one or more data files, other metdata files and a manifest file that describes what each file is for. This could be to load data for linkage, extract linkage keys for specified source records, or even modify the groupings of records.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/event-types":{"id":"concepts/event-types","title":"Event Types","description":"An event type is a data collection which is being provided by a Data Provider. As with Data Providers, Event Types are created, edited and deleted through the Web Interface. Event types belong to a data provider \u2013 they cannot be created separately from them. A Data Provider may provide any number of Event Types. For instance, a health department could provide hospital admission, emergency department presentation or cancer registry event types.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/import-formats":{"id":"concepts/import-formats","title":"Import Formats","description":"The Import Format provides a description of the layout of the data files to be received for a Data Source. Each Data Source has one import format associated with it, and it is assumed that all files/data received for a single Data Source be in the same format. A Data Source\'s import format can be modified if the format changes over time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/linkage-projects":{"id":"concepts/linkage-projects","title":"Linkage Projects","description":"A Linkage Project is a collection of Event Types that will be linked to each other. Event types can be in more than one Linkage Project. Linkage Projects offer a large amount of flexibility and can handle a number of common linkage scenarios, including:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/workflows":{"id":"concepts/workflows","title":"Workflows","description":"Workflows are long running processes, managed by the system, and represent the orchestration of a specific set of activities. These activities can include the loading of data for linkages and the extraction of linkage results.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/data-preprocessing":{"id":"guides/data-preprocessing","title":"Data pre-processing","description":"Once the appropriate metadata have been added regarding Data Providers, Event Types, Data Sources, Import Formats and Linkage Projects, LinXmart is ready to accept data for linkage.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/destroying-record-data":{"id":"guides/destroying-record-data","title":"Destroying record-level data","description":"LinXmart stores personally identifying information (PII) as part of the process of linking datasets together. However, sometimes it is required (by agreement) or desired to destroy the PII data after it has been used. LinXmart can clear the sensitive PII data stored for records without deleting the linkage itself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/extracting-data":{"id":"guides/extracting-data","title":"Extracting linkage keys","description":"LinXmart is designed to provide linkage keys identifying records belonging to the same person within and across datasets.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/grouping-config":{"id":"guides/grouping-config","title":"Merge vs best-link grouping","description":"The matching process performed by LinXmart results in a number of matching pairs that represent weighted likelihoods between different records. In order to create sets (or groups) of records that represent individual entities, these pairs need to go through a grouping process. By default, LinXmart uses a merge-based grouping strategy.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/import-export-data-providers":{"id":"guides/import-export-data-providers","title":"Import / Export of Data Providers","description":"There are a few reasons why you might want to import/export the full data provider configuration:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/import-export-project-config":{"id":"guides/import-export-project-config","title":"Import / Export of Linkage Project Settings","description":"There are a few reasons why you might want to import/export all settings for a linkage project:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/loading-data/data-formats":{"id":"guides/loading-data/data-formats","title":"Data file formats","description":"Specific file formats are required for the different types of data that can be loaded into a Linkage Project.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/loading-data/loading-envelope":{"id":"guides/loading-data/loading-envelope","title":"Loading in an Envelope","description":"An Envelope can contain a data file that is marked for linkage. The Envelope\'s manifest will specify a target Linkage Project for the data, as well as the Event Type the data should be classified. Other Envelope types will have other metadata describing how the data should be used by the system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/index":{"id":"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/index","title":"Loading data into a Project","description":"On the summary page for a Linkage Project, there is a list of all Event Types that have been attached to the project.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/loading-batch":{"id":"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/loading-batch","title":"Bulk load of multiple data sets","description":"Triggering the load of many data sets at the same time can be done from the `Bulk Load Data` link on the Linkage Project page, below the list of Event Types.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/loading-single":{"id":"guides/loading-data/loading-from-project/loading-single","title":"Loading a single data set","description":"Loading data from a single data set can be initiated directly from the `Upload Data File` link on the Linkage Project page, below the list of Event Types.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/matching-config":{"id":"guides/matching-config","title":"Defining matching strategies","description":"LinXmart utilises a probabilistic linkage engine. This engine uses a \'match configuration\' that tells it how to compare records, and when to designate two records as a match. Each Linkage Project has a separate match configuration, and a Linkage Project\u2019s match configuration can be modified at any time. After modification, all future linkages will use the new match configuration, while previous linkages will not change.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"guides/monitoring-activity":{"id":"guides/monitoring-activity","title":"Monitoring activity","description":"All data processing by the system is run through the Job Queue.
