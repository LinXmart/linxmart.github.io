In this approach, records are compared on a pairwise basis. A comparison of two records involves comparing all the individual fields. Each field comparison results in a score based on specific weights assigned to that field. These scores are summed up for the pair comparison, and if this summed score is over a specific threshold, the two records are designated a match.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/data-providers":{"id":"concepts/data-providers","title":"Data Providers","description":"Data Providers are the organisations/people who have agreed to provide data to LinXmart. All data received by the system must be associated with (i.e. belong to) a Data Provider. Event Types and Datasources both exist within the context of a Data Provider.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/data-sources":{"id":"concepts/data-sources","title":"Data Sources","description":"A data source represents the location from which a specific type of data can be ingested into the system.

These are listed below the Event Type itself.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/envelopes":{"id":"concepts/envelopes","title":"Envelopes","description":"At its simplest, a LinXmart Envelope is a dataset paired with a descriptor that tells LinXmart what to do with it. These Envelopes exist as standard zip files containing one or more data files, other metdata files and a manifest file that describes what each file is for. This could be to load data for linkage, extract linkage keys for specified source records, or even modify the groupings of records.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/event-types":{"id":"concepts/event-types","title":"Event Types","description":"An event type is a data collection which is being provided by a Data Provider. As with Data Providers, Event Types are created, edited and deleted through the Web Interface. Event types belong to a data provider \u2013 they cannot be created separately from them. A Data Provider may provide any number of Event Types. For instance, a health department could provide hospital admission, emergency department presentation or cancer registry event types.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/import-formats":{"id":"concepts/import-formats","title":"Import Formats","description":"The Import Format provides a description of the layout of the data files to be received for a Data Source.
