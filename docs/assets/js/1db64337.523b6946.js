It provides ongoing linkage capability for all linkage projects, allowing any number of datasets to be linked together. This allows complex, long-running linkage projects to be managed, with new records added incrementally over time as data collections are updated and new collections come on stream. Multiple linkage projects can be created, with each project siloed and data only linked within a project. LinXmart has been designed to provide for a range of common linkage scenarios, including the linking of client-provided data to an ongoing linkage map. The software handles both static and dynamic records, where field values can change over time. It has a suite of tools for ensuring high linkage quality. The full history of all changes to the linkage map is stored, with the ability to effectively \u2018roll back\u2019 to any point in time to re-establish the groupings.
